Usage: jtfm [<file-or-dir>...]
       jtfm [-h|--help]

Create and run comment tests...just the facts, ma'am.

Parameters:

  <file-or-dir>          path to file or directory

Options:

  -h, --help             show this output

Configuration:

  .jtfm.jdn              configuration file

Examples:

  Create and run tests in `src/` directory:

  $ jtfm src

  `jtfm` can be used via `jpm`, `jeep`, etc. with
  some one-time setup.  Create a suitable `.jtfm.jdn`
  file in a project's root directory and a runner
  file in a project's `test/` subdirectory (see below
  for further details).

  Run via `jeep test`:

  $ jeep test

  Run via `jpm test`:

  $ jpm test

  Run using the configuration file via direct
  invocation:

  $ jtfm

Example `.jtfm.jdn` content:

  {# describes what to test - file and dir paths
   :includes ["src" "bin/my-script"]
   # describes what to skip - file paths only
   :excludes ["src/sample.janet"]}

Example runner file `test/trigger-jtfm.janet`:

  (import ../jtfm)

  (jtfm/main)
